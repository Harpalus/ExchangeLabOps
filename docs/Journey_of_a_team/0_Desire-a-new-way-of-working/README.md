# Phase 0: Desire a new way of working

Have you been working towards delivering value in your organization and feel that the systems or process are challenging your ability to get results? Particularly when there is technology involved?

**Maybe it's time to step back and consider some new ways of working.** Your friends at the Exchange lab have done that, and are having lots of learning, success, and fun. We're keen to share. In particular, we apply Agile mindset and methods to delivery value more quickly, with less wasted resources, and to people's expectations.

When people hear about us, they aren't quite sure if we are private sector or public sector. It's that much of a difference. 

So, we encourage you to suspend your disbelief, tap into your growth mindset, and explore the journey of a Lab team. There's plenty you can take away and apply without having to reside at the lab.
