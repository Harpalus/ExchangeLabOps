# Phase 2: Build a Minimum Viable Product

During this phase, a new team starts working on the proof of concept they have imagined as a result of what was discovered in phase 1.

The process includes building an Alpha product to test with users (this may even be paper prototypes) and then moving towards a beta product that is working software.

Lab Operations support teams through this with coaching, facilitation and support to use modern tools. 

# How long does it take?

It depends on the team and the product, but it is normal for a team to deliver a product to the public, that they can use and that delivers REAL value within six months.

The Lab Operations team is working on putting together some case studies to illustrate how this is possible.
