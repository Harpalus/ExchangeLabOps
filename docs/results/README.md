# Exchange Lab Operations - Results and Performance

How do we know if we are successful? This is one of the first questions all teams ask when they set out to solve a problem.

Our team is developing our performance management tools and processes. This includes:

* An impact map to guide our programs
* Metrics and targets
* Surveys and statistics to indicate progress
* Open reporting on results

Expect to see more here in January 2020.
