# About the Exchange Lab - Formerly the Continuous Service Improvement (CSI) Lab

The BCDevExchange exists at the leading edge of delivery-driven government in British Columbia. We are here to improve people's lives, address the province's priorities and improve the public's experience of government. We do this by providing a platform of services to support the design and build of the digital public services that the people of the province expect. We partner across and beyond government to support the open collaboration, engagement and enablement of teams committed to creating public value through digital service delivery.  

The BCDevExchange organization embraces experimentation, innovation and empowerment. By adopting the principles, values and practices of the BCDevExchange, partner government entities adapt their typical ways of working to better align with leading practice amongst technology companies and digital agencies. As a result, the BCDevExchange is changing the way program areas throughout government and the broader public sector engage and work together. 

Our work centers around the Exchange Lab (previously known as the Continuous Service Improvement, or CSI Lab) â€“ the physical place from which the BCDevExchange program delivers its services, centers its engagement efforts, and hosts digital delivery teams working to solve priority public challenges. 

At the Lab, the BCDevExchange partners with Ministry program areas to build Digital Delivery Teams. We train these teams in methods aligned to an Agile mindset, equip them with enabling processes and technology, and empower them to use these tools and teamwork to build better public services. 

Delivery Teams at the Lab are surrounded by mentors and experts in DevOps, service design, behavioral insights, innovation, privacy, security, and data. These disciplines combine with the Agile approach to development to enable teams to deliver small increments of value quickly. Teams learn and improve their product with direct feedback from users every few weeks and deliver substantial value within a year.

These teams, connected and supported by the BCDevExchange, pay it forward to a growing community of change makers by offering learning events and mentorship. These and other programs and experiences offered at the Lab are continuously improved
