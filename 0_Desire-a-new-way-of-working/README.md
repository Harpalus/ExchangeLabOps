## Phase 0: Desire a new way of working & apply to work with or at the Exchange Lab

Have you been working towards delivering value in your organization and feel that the systems or process are challenging your ability to get results? Particularly when there is technology involved?

Maybe it's time to step back and consider some new ways of working. Your friends at the Exchange lab have done that, and are having lots of learning, success, and fun. We're keen to share.

Lab teams and community members are surrounded by mentors and experts in DevOps, service design, behavioral insights, innovation, privacy, security, and data. These disciplines combine with the agile approach to development to enable teams to deliver small increments of value quickly. Teams learn and improve their product with direct feedback from users every few weeks and deliver substantial value within a year.

* [Learn about the full Journey of a Team](https://github.com/bcgov/ExchangeLabOps/blob/master/One-Pager_Journey-of-an-Exchange-Lab-Team.pdf).

Teams pay it forward to a growing community of change makers, by offering learning events and mentorship. 

## How our current intake process works:

1. [Take a Tour of the Exchange Lab](https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/take-a-walk-on-the-agile-side-tour-of-bc-govs-csi-lab-tickets-43946375793) and hear first hand how teams are re-inventing services delivery as Digital Product Teams. 
2. Connect with other innovation discaplines to help you think about how you might explore opportunities for service improvement (see [using ideas at work](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/careers-myhr/all-employees/new-employees/next-steps/first-six-months))
3. Consider what problem you might address with these new methods. (What have you been stuck on? Where could you start small?). [Fill out a Value Canvas](https://github.com/bcgov/ExchangeLabOps/blob/master/0_Desire-a-new-way-of-working/Lab-Residency_Intake-Value-Canvas-Workbook.pdf).
4. Attend a Lab Info Session (coming soon!)
5. Meet with Exchange Lab leadership to discuss the opportunities available to you to get started. [Contact the LabOps Team](ExchangeLab@gov.bc.ca).
6. If you are close to meeting readiness critieria, we facilitate an Alignment session for the Product Owner, their leadership and stakeholders.
7. If Alignment is successful, we get to sign the [Partnership Agreement](https://github.com/bcgov/ExchangeLabOps/blob/master/0_Desire-a-new-way-of-working/Lab-Residency-Partnership-Agreement.pdf).
8. Get started!
